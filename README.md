# PascalCoin Protobuf

This repo contains proto definitions for PascalCoin types. For usage, see the tests folder.

## Developing

First, obtain the Protocol Compiler. The easiest way is to download a pre-built binary from https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases.

Look for the zip file named protoc for your platform. I.e. protoc-3.8.0-linux-x86_64.zip

Extract and move protoc into your $PATH

```
$ yarn
$ yarn build
```
